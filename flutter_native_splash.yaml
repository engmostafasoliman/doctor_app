flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Steps to make this work:
  # 1. Customize the parameters below.
  # 2. run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create -p ../your-filepath.yaml
  # 3. voila, done!

  # NOTES:
  # - in case you got some trouble, cleaning up flutter project might help:
  # flutter clean ; flutter pub get
  # - To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove -p ../your-filepath.yaml

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below, at the very end.
